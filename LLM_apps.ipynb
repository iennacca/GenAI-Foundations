    "For now, both tools may look the same. One difference can easily be seen in LlamaIndex' ability to use a tree structure. The Tree Index allows you to build a hierarchical structure, where documents are segmented into chunks, and each chunk is stored as a node in a tree. This allows you to retrieve documents while keeping the context (the spot in the hierarchy where the data appeared). By contrast, LangChain operates on a flat structure."

If you don't know the answer, just say that you don't know, don't try to make up an answer.\\n\\nLessing has advanced excellent reasons fo r supposing that the Martians have actually \\nsucceeded in effecting a landing on the planet  Venus. Seven months ago now, Venus and \\nMars were in alignment with the sun; that  is to say, Mars was in opposition from the \\npoint of view of an observer on Venus. Subsequently a peculiar luminous and sinuous \\nmark- ing appeared on the unillumined half of the inner planet, and almost \\nsimultaneously a faint dark mark of a similar sinuous character was detected upon a \\nphotograph of the Martian disk. One needs to see the drawings of these ap- pearances in \\norder to appreciate fully their remarkable resemblance in character.  \\nAt any rate, whether we expect another inva sion or not, our views of the human future \\nmust be greatly modified by these events. We  have learned now that we cannot regard \\nthis planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate\\n\\nthis planet as being fenced in and a secure abiding place for Man; we can never anticipate \\nthe unseen good or evil that may come upon us suddenly out of space. It may be that in \\nthe larger design of the universe this invasion from Mars is not  without its ultimate \\nbenefit for men; it has robbed us of that serene confidence in the future which is the most \\nfruitful source of decadence, the gifts to human science it has brought are enormous, and \\nit has done much to promote th e conception of the commonweal of mankind. It may be \\nthat across the immensity of space the Martians have watched the fate of these pioneers \\nof theirs and learned their lesson, and that on the planet Venus they have found a securer \\nsettlement. Be that as it may, for many year s yet there will certainly be no relaxation of \\nthe eager scrutiny of the Martian disk, and thos e fiery darts of the sky, the shooting stars, \\nwill bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.\\n\\ntriangular window. And afterwards I found it broadcast throughout the country, and \\nespecially wherever there was a stream of water.  \\n   The Martians had what appears to have been an auditory organ, a single round drum at \\nthe back of the head-body, and eyes with a visual range not very  different from ours \\nexcept that, according to Philips, blue and violet  were as black to them. It is commonly \\nsupposed that they com- municated by sounds  and tentacular gesticulations; this is \\nasserted, for instance, in the able but hastily compiled pamphlet  (written evidently by \\nsomeone not an eye-witness of Martian acti ons) to which I have already alluded, and \\nwhich, so far, has been the chief source of information con- cerning them. Now no \\nsurviving human being saw so much of the Mar tians in action as I did. I take no credit to \\nmyself for an accident, but the fact is so. A nd I assert that I watc hed them closely time\\n\\nwill bring with them as they fall an unavoidable apprehension to all the sons of men.  \\n   The broadening of men's views that has re sulted can scarcely be exaggerated. Before \\nthe cylinder fell there was a general persuasi on that through all the deep of space no life \\nexisted beyond the petty surface of our minut e sphere. Now we see further. If the \\nMartians can reach Venus, there is no reason to suppose that the thing is impossible for \\nmen, and when the slow cooling of the sun make s this earth uninhabitable, as at last it \\nmust do, it may be that the thread of life th at has begun here will have streamed out and \\ncaught our sister planet within its toils.  \\n   Dim and wonderful is the vision I have conjured up in my mind of life spreading slowly \\nfrom this little seed bed of the solar system throughout the inanimate vastness of sidereal \\nspace.

In addition, Ogilvy\\'s wire to the Astronomical Exchange had roused every \\nobservatory in the three kingdoms.  \\n   There were half a dozen flies or more fr om the Woking station st anding in the road by \\nthe sand pits, a basket- chaise from Chobham, and a rather lordly ca rriage. Besides that, \\nthere was quite a heap of bicycles. In addition, a large number of people must have \\nwalked, in spite of the heat  of the day, from Woking and Chertsey, so that there was \\naltogether quite a considerable crowd--one or two gaily dressed ladies among the others. \\n  It was glaringly hot, not a cloud in the sky nor a breath of wind, and the only shadow \\nwas that of the few scattered pine trees. The burning heather had been extinguished, but \\nthe level ground towards Ottershaw was blacke ned as far as one could see, and still\\n\\nthunder- storm mingled there with masses of black and red smoke.  \\n   Ripley Street was deserted, and except for a lighted window or so the villa ge showed \\nnot a sign of life; but I narrowly escaped an accident at the corn er of the road to Pyrford, \\nwhere a knot of people stood with their backs to me. They said nothing to me as I passed. \\nI do not know what they knew of the things happening beyond the hill, nor do I know if \\nthe silent houses I passed on my way were sl eeping securely, or deserted and empty, or \\nharassed and watching against the terror of the night.\\n\\nOnce the tumultuous upheaval of its di spersion was over, the black smoke clung so \\nclosely to the ground, even before its precipita tion, that fifty feet up in the air, on the \\nroofs and upper stories of high houses and on great trees, there was a chance of escaping \\nits poison altogether, as was proved even that night at Street Cobham and Ditton.  \\nThe man who escaped at the former place tells a wonderful story of the strangeness of its \\ncoiling flow, and how he looked down from the church spire and saw the houses of the \\nvillage rising like ghosts out of its inky nothi ngness. For a day and a half he remained \\nthere, weary, starving and sun-scorched, th e earth under the blue sky and against the \\nprospect of the distant hills a velvet-black e xpanse, with red roofs, green trees, and, later, \\nblack-veiled shrubs and gates, barns, out- houses, and walls, rising here and there into the \\nsunlight.\\n\\nFrom Ripley until I came through Pyrford I was in the valley of the Wey, and the red \\nglare was hidden from me. As I ascended the little hill beyond Pyrf ord Church the glare \\ncame into view again, and the trees about me shivered with the first intimation of the \\nstorm that was upon me. Then I heard midnight  pealing out from Pyrford Church behind \\nme, and then came the silhouette of Maybury Hill,  with its tree- tops and roofs black and \\nsharp against the red.  \\n   Even as I beheld this a lurid green glar e lit the road about me and showed the distant \\nwoods towards Addlestone. I felt a tug at the reins. I saw that the driving clouds had been \\npierced as it were by a thread of green fire, suddenly lighting their confusion and falling \\ninto the field to my left. It was the third falling star!  \\n   Close on its apparition, and blindingly violet by contrast, danced out the first lightning \\nof the gathering storm, and the thunder burst  like a rocket overhead.
